# What

- Frontend for headless cms.
- Presentation of notes (bits).
  - Information that I will presumably want to get back to in future.
- To be publicly accessible from the internet.
- __WIP__.

# Why

1. While programming, reading, reasearching, I do encounter bits of information forming knowledge that is easily forgotten, when not used for some some time (months). To overcome this I've decided to save those bits into cms and build simple frontend so it is easily accessible.
2. While building the frontend I'd like to excercise use of `nextjs`, `typescript`, _headless cms_ and more, as to try out and evaluate current (2021 and further) frontend building approaches for purposes of future projects. Long story short, to refresh my knowledge on how frontend is built.

# How

Used:
- nextjs,
- typescript,
- tailwindcss,
- md in react

# Status

Working draft of frontend for mobile and desktop.

# Further

- Breadcrumbs,
  - with headers title.
- Tags.
- Search and filter posts.
- Ability to pin a post.
